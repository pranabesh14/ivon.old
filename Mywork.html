Homicide detective Thomas learns this whilst on the run from his own department, accused of a crime that he did not commit. Unsuccessful in his pursuit of the real culprit, the whole conspiracy seems to present itself as something more than mere coincidence, especially when fate throws a mysterious girl named Sarah his way. Together with an old friend and historian Jane, he tries to unravel a secret that could shake the foundations of human knowledge of the Universe.</li>
